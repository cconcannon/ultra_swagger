# As a visiting user
# when I visit "root/reviews/shoes"
# I see all the shoes by their default order
# and I have checkbox options to filter reviews by "Temperature", "Climate Conditions" and "Trail Characteristics"
# and when I click the option "Trail Characteristics: smooth"
# then the arrangement of the reviews changes
# and the best_reviewed item for "smooth" trail characteristics is first
# 
# and when I un-click the option to filter reviews
# then the arrangement changes back to initial state
