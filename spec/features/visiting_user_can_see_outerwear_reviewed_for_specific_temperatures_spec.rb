# As a visiting user
# when I visit "root/reviews/outerwear"
# I see all the outerwear items by their default order
# and I have checkbox options to filter reviews by "Temperatures" and "Climate Conditions"
# and when I click the option "Temperatures: extremely cold"
# then the arrangement of the reviews changes
# and the best-reviewed item for "extremely cold" temperatures is first
# 
# and when I un-click the option to filter reviews
# then the arrangement changes back to initial state
