As a registered user
when I visit "root/login"
I click a link to "login with Strava"
and I log in with Strava OAuth
I am redirected to "root/users/:id"
and I see "Welcome, "
and I can see all my approved reviews listed by date descending
and I can see all my pending reviews listed by date descending
and I see a link to "Submit a new product review"
and I can see my Strava statistics which get tagged to new reviews
