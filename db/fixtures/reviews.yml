  comments: Grippy in the wet stuff, yet lightweight and flexible. Supportive enough for 100 miles. My go-to shoe for everything on trail.

  comments: Lightweight and breathable, but still somewhat 'bouncy'... I ended up modifying the pack so that the bottles sit higher. Out of the box, it's not as great a fit as their AK vest. Nice size for warm-weather ultras.

  comments: These are my go-to for all runs longer than a few hours. They're a little warm for hot weather running, but otherwise perfect. The built-in liner is a great feature.

  comments: Greatest lightweight shell, ever! Not waterproof, but it does the job as an emergency layer (or extremely lightweight wind blocker).
