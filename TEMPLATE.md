### Ultra Swagger

### Pitch

Ultramarathon runners want running gear reviews which reflect heavy use under harsh conditions, and which provide more detail than the status quo reviews by average weekend warriors. 

### Problem

Most running gear is reviewed online by average Jane's or Joe's which lace up their shoes for, at most, a couple hours per week. Athletes training for ultramarathons of 31-100 miles spend much more time out training, and usually encounter much harsher conditions in training and races than the average runner. It is currently time-consuming for these ultramarathoners to filter through gear review sites to choose the best gear for their needs. 

### Solution

Ultra Swagger will accept reviews from ultrarunners, but will also be required to submit races in which they used that particular piece of gear. I will filter the gear reviews based on race distances, climate, terrain, and the runner's relative ability. I will consume API data from Athlinks.com to validate the runner's participation in an event and to retrieve their relative performance. I will also consume a weather API to retrieve high and low temperature averages and conditions for the event location. I will then combine those details with a very simple submission form which allows them to rate their gear in less than 30 seconds. 

### Target Audience

Ultramarathon runners are the target audience for this application. In 2013, nearly 70,000 athletes finished an ultramarathon in the US, with over 200,000 finishes globally. In 2014 alone, the number of 100-mile event finishers alone grew by 17 percent. The sport is still growing faster than ever, and Ultra Swagger will fill a niche market gap for runners making the leap to ultramarathon running.
